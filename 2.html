He was really distressed, I was cold to him,
I did not help him <br>I thought that anyone had a painful thing <br>and I had to endure it myself.
But the reality is not:
 a person has a line that can not stand for himself, and when he crosses that line,
 he makes a choice that can not come back
<strong>He had already crossed the line for a long time ago,
</strong> and during the summer vacation he took <u><html lang="ko">his own life</u></html lang="ko">
Since then I've been trying to help if someone is in trouble. <p><br>And as I have,
  many people seemed to think that he should endure someone's mental pain on his own,
   but I hope you know that he is not.
A person can not solve everything by himself. <p>hello
  Look at the sky at night.
  We can see stars in the sky.
  And we can see some patterns in the star.
  <p>Some patterns look like people.Other patterns look like animals.
  </p><p style="margin-top:60px;">These patterns are constellations.
  We can't always see the same constellations.
  They change from season to season. Why?The earth spins.
  It also goes around the sun.And some stars go behind the sun.
  Then we can't see them from the earth.
  So we see different constellations each season.
